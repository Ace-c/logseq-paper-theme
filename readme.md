# Paper Theme


The [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) Paper theme is a minimal theme, where the page and journal container is elevated from the user interface. Therefore putting it front and center for a distractionless writing experience.


## Usage

The easiest way to adopt this theme is to use jsDelivr CDN by adding the following lines to your `custom.css`.

```css
/* This must be the first line of the custom.css with other import rules */
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ace-c/logseq-paper-theme/refs/heads/master/custom.css");

/* Add these variables to your custom.css if you want to hide these page elements in the UI. Remove them to make them visible again. */
:root {
  --display-recent-pages: none;
  --display-search-button: none;
  --display-arrow-navigation: none;
  --display-help-button: none;
}

/* You can also add other styles below to override the default theme values */
```

Alternatively, you can download this repo and load it as a Logseq Theme Plugin.
